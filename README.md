Getting practice.
My name is **bold text** Donna Lemon. I believe that: >blockquote "You're never to old to set a new goal, or dream a new dream." That's why I'm here, learning to become a Java Full Stack Web Developer at 61 years old. I'm on track to work at Vanguard Investments as a Jr. Java Full Stack Web Developer in August 2022. What a scary and exciting journey this is already turning out to be! ![my pic]![IMG_2469 (3)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93051027/163697934-2f31a668-7c51-415c-98db-2af47a0a2365.JPG)
